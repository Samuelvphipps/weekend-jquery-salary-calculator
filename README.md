# PROJECT NAME

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

The base mode content probably took around 5 hours. The css extras took me another hour. I spent quite a bit of time working on the stretch goal. I figured out how to search through an array of objects to find an object with a specified property value. I just havent figured out a way to use the deleted row info using the data() function.
