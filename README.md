# PROJECT NAME

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

The base mode content probably took around 3-4 hours. The css extras took me another few hours. I spent quite a bit of time working on the stretch goal on saturday but was just stuck. 
After stepping away I was able to reorient my focus, and through that I was able to come up with a solution that I thought might work. I wrote down a for loop and dom traverse idea before going to sleep then tested it in the morning. It worked! Super excited to have struggled through that.
